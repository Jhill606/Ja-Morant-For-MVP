    <h3>Xbox Series S</h3>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S#Xbox_Series_S"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Xbox_Series_S_with_controller.jpg/1024px-Xbox_Series_S_with_controller.jpg" width="230px" height="270px"></a>
    <p>Due to the high price of the Xbox Series X, Microsoft announced the <i>Xbox</i> Series S in September 2020. It would be released at the same time as the Xbox Series X, and be priced at a more reasonable ammount. It would of course, be less powerful, but was a better option for most people. It runs all of the same games as it's more powerfuul brother, and has a similar design. It is significantly smaller (by about 60%) and is white. The controller is the exact same, and can be shared between systems. It does not support ray tracing and can reach quality of up to 60 frames per second. The Xbox Series X is an understandable $299, which is exactly half of the price of the Series X. Within the first 24 hours of the launch, the combined sales of the consoles had reached 1 million. After 1 month it had hit 3.5 million, and after 8 months, it would be 6.5 million. The end of 2021 would bring 12 million total units sold, shattering the previous record held by the Xbox One. It was designed to be able to fit inside of a small bag or bookbag. It has a high tech cooling system, which is able to keep the console at a steady temperature. The Xbox Series X was a revolutionary step for Microsoft and one that paid off big time. Secondary consoles will surely become a common occurance in the future, and will increase profits for companies. Microsoft has started a trend that will stay around for a long time.  </p>
