    <p>In 2012 Microsoft took their third expedition into console-making. Announced in 2013 and released in late 2014, the <i>Xbox One</i> was the first console to be marketed as an all in one home entertainment system, thus being named the Xbox One. It returned to the architecture used by the original Xbox. It was the most powerful Xbox made at that time for video games, but also featured the ability to play Blu-Ray discs and connect to live television. The sales of the Xbox One were by far the highest the brand had ever seen, because for the first time the Xbox was avalaible for purchase in China. This version of the console also featured a more refined and accurate version of the Kinect, but was no longer a main feature or was a free addition. The Xbox One was praised for it's sleek design and quietness of it's fan compared to the previous version. It still received criticism for being less graphically impressive than the Playstation 4. Sony still outsold them, selling about 36 million units as of January 2016, with Microsoft selling 18 million around the same time. One thing that Xbox beat Playstation in though, was a new feature called "backwards compatibility". It meant that the Xbox One could play certain popular original Xbox and Xbox 360 games on the Xbox One console. This technology was revolutionary and will change gaming forever. The Xbox One was the least popular edition to that point, but it made many revolutionary experiments and improved the industry for years to come.</p>
