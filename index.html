   <p>After the tremendous success of the Sony-made Playstation 2 and Nintendo's Gamecube, Microsoft decided to produce their own home console.
    Microsoft began development in late 1998 on their console, using ideas and adding upon their rivals previous creations. Being released 
    worldwide between November 15, 2001 and March 14, 2002. 24 million units were sold during it's lifespan. 
    It was extremely successful, but about 82 million more Playstation 2 units were sold. The <i>Xbox</i> was described as large and clunky, but revolutionary
    for it's time. It was the first console to have a built in hard disk drive used for downloading and saving games to Xbox Live. 
    Although the Xbox did many things to the level of, and even better than the Playstation 2, the name recognition and sleeker apperance
     of the Japanese product drove up sales. Because they had by far the most powerful console on the market at the time, Microsoft had many Xbox exclusives. 
     From the current fan-favorite Halo, to defunct games like Project Gotham Racing, which was like a Batman type Mario Kart, and Dead or Alive 3. 
     They had many exclusive games such as these, but also had the shared games between consoles and brands. Microsoft brought many of their features on their 
      already popular Windows PC's and implemented them onto their new console. The result was one of the most high-quality and
       memorable video game consoles of all time. Although Microsoft took a financial loss because of the high production cost, 
       it laid a strong foundation for their future endeavors.Five years after their initial debut into console-making, Microsoft introduced the <i>Xbox 360</i>.
       Unlike it's predecessor, this was an instant success upon release. Going up for sale six monts after the official announcement in May of 2005,
       it quickly became the fifth highest selling console of all time and the highest selling American-made console of all time. It's popularity was so immense that supplies
       ran low in North America and Europe. While Sony still led the way in sales and profit, Microsoft was building a reputation for their high-quality and revolutionary devices.
       The 360 was the first game to heavily push online gaming and digital media. It was also the first Xbox to have wireless controllers. It was also the first console to 
       experiment with motion sensing technology as a heavily-advertised part of their package. It was named the Kinect and was used for family-friendly active games to be played 
       standing up and moving. The Kinect encouraged active lifestyles and family fun. The free addition to the system proved to be unpopular and was no longer packaged with later 
       additions of the system. It became the first console of that generation to reach 10 million units sold globally, and it quickly sold out everywhere in the world except for 
       Japan. That is understandable because their rival Sony, is based in Japan. One major issue with the console was only revealed well after the final unit was sold. After years
       of use, the console would quit on it's owner. It commonly became known as the "Red Ring Of Death." It gained this moniker because of it's four red lights illuminating in a 
        circle. This problem was discovered years down the line, as the consoles became obsolete. 
        The console will go down as the most sucessful in Microsoft's history to this point, and the highest moment in the series.In 2012 Microsoft took their third
        expedition into console-making. Announced in 2013 and released in late 2014, the <i>Xbox One</i> was the first console to be marketed as an all in one home 
        entertainment system, thus being named the Xbox One. It returned to the architecture used by the original Xbox. It was the most powerful Xbox made at that time for video
        games, but also featured the ability to play Blu-Ray discs and connect to live television. The sales of the Xbox One were by far the highest the brand had ever seen,
        because for the first time the Xbox was avalaible for purchase in China. This version of the console also featured a more refined and accurate version of the Kinect, 
        but was no longer a main feature or was a free addition. The Xbox One was praised for it's sleek design and quietness of it's fan compared to the previous version.
        It still received criticism for being less graphically impressive than the Playstation 4. Sony still outsold them, selling about 36 million units as of January 2016,
        with Microsoft selling 18 million around the same time. One thing that Xbox beat Playstation in though, was a new feature called "backwards compatibility". 
        It meant that the Xbox One could play certain popular original Xbox and Xbox 360 games on the Xbox One console. This technology was revolutionary and will change gaming forever.
        The Xbox One was the least popular edition to that point, but it made many revolutionary experiments and improved the industry for years to come. Following the technological success that was the Xbox One, 
        Microsoft announced their fourth main entry into the series at E3 2019 on June 12, 2019. Codenamed "Project Scarlett, it was set to be the most powerful system ever made, even exceeding Microsoft's PC's. 
        They aimed to double the power of the already powerful Xbox One. In December 2019, the design and name <i>Xbox Series</i> X was revealed at The Game Awards. The console supported 8K resolution as well as ray-tracing and
        120 frames per second. This would be the most graphically-impressive Xbox or video game console ever made. It was designed to be unintrusive and take up as little space as possible for the hardware that was required. This edition 
        further improved on the idea of backwards compatability, bringing the total game library to 632 out of the 2,154 games avalible, not including the thousands of games avalable that were made for the Xbox Series X. With the release of the
        console along with it's rival PlayStation 5 in November 2020, both consoles sold out in minutes and were almost impossible to come across. The already expensive $600 retail price tag would then go as high as $1,000 on resale sites. The main point
        of detractors was that the console lacked any exclusives on launch. The main exclusive was Halo Infinite, which still has not released to this day. The other main one was Microsoft Flight Simulator. For the previous 20 years, it was only available
        on Windows, but the newfound power of the Xbox Series X allowed flight enthusiasts like me to take to the skies. Due to the high price of the Xbox Series X, Microsoft announced the <i>Xbox</i> Series S in September 2020. It would be released at the
        same time as the Xbox Series X, and be priced at a more reasonable ammount. It would of course, be less powerful, but was a better option for most people. It runs all of the same games as it's more powerfuul brother, and has a similar design. It is
        significantly smaller (by about 60%) and is white. The controller is the exact same, and can be shared between systems. It does not support ray tracing and can reach quality of up to 60 frames per second. The Xbox Series X is an understandable $299,
        which is exactly half of the price of the Series X. Within the first 24 hours of the launch, the combined sales of the consoles had reached 1 million. After 1 month it had hit 3.5 million, and after 8 months, it would be 6.5 million. The end of 2021
        would bring 12 million total units sold, shattering the previous record held by the Xbox One. It was designed to be able to fit inside of a small bag or bookbag. It has a high tech cooling system, which is able to keep the console at a steady temperature.
        The Xbox Series X was a revolutionary step for Microsoft and one that paid off big time. Secondary consoles will surely become a common occurance in the future, and will increase profits for companies. Microsoft has started a trend that will stay around
        for a long time.
