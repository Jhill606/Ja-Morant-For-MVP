    <h1>The Evolution Of Xbox</h1>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Xbox-console.jpg/250px-Xbox-console.jpg"></a>
      <p>After the tremendous success of the Sony-made Playstation 2 and Nintendo's Gamecube, Microsoft decided to produce their own home console. Microsoft began development in late 1998 on their console, using ideas and adding upon their rivals previous creations. Being released worldwide between November 15, 2001 and March 14, 2002. 24 million units were sold during it's lifespan. It was extremely successful, but about 82 million more Playstation 2 units were sold. The console was described as large and clunky, but revolutionary for it's time. It was the first console to have a built in hard disk drive used for downloading and saving games to Xbox Live. Although the Xbox did many things to the level of, and even better than the Playstation 2, the name recognition and sleeker apperance of the Japanese product drove up sales. Because they had by far the most powerful console on the market at the time, Microsoft had many Xbox exclusives. From the current fan-favorite Halo, to defunct games like Project Gotham Racing, which was like a Batman type Mario Kart, and Dead or Alive 3. They had many exclusive games such as these, but also had the shared games between consoles and brands. Microsoft brought many of their features on their already popular Windows PC's and implemented them onto their new console. The result was one of the most high-quality and memorable video game consoles of all time. Although Microsoft took a financial loss because of the high production cost, it laid a strong foundation for their future endeavors.</p>

    <p>Five years after their initial debut into console-making, Microsoft introduced the Xbox 360. Unlike it's predecessor, this was an instant success upon release. Going up for sale six monts after the official announcement in May of 2005, it quickly became the fifth highest selling console of all time and the highest selling American-made console of all time. It's popularity was so immense that supplies ran low in North America and Europe. </p>
