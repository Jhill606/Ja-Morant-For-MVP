    <p>Following the technological success that was the Xbox One, Microsoft announced their fourth main entry into the series at E3 2019 on June 12, 2019. Codenamed "Project Scarlett, it was set to be the most powerful system ever made, even exceeding Microsoft's PC's. They aimed to double the power of the already powerful Xbox One. In December 2019, the design and name <i>Xbox Series</i> X was revealed at The Game Awards. The console supported 8K resolution as well as ray-tracing and 120 frames per second. This would be the most graphically-impressive Xbox or video game console ever made. It was designed to be unintrusive and take up as little space as possible for the hardware that was required. This edition further improved on the idea of backwards compatability, bringing the total game library to 632 out of the 2,154 games avalible, not including the thousands of games avalable that were made for the Xbox Series X. With the release of the console along with it's rival PlayStation 5 in November 2020, both consoles sold out in minutes and were almost impossible to come across. The already expensive $600 retail price tag would then go as high as $1,000 on resale sites. The main point of detractors was that the console lacked any exclusives on launch. The main exclusive was Halo Infinite, which still has not released to this day. The other main one was Microsoft Flight Simulator. For the previous 20 years, it was only available on Windows, but the newfound power of the Xbox Series X allowed flight enthusiasts like me to take to the skies.</p>
