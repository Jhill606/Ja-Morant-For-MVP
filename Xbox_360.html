<h3>Xbox 360</h3>

    <p>Five years after their initial debut into console-making, Microsoft introduced the <i>Xbox 360</i>. Unlike it's predecessor, this was an instant success upon release. Going up for sale six monts after the official announcement in May of 2005, it quickly became the fifth highest selling console of all time and the highest selling American-made console of all time. It's popularity was so immense that supplies ran low in North America and Europe. While Sony still led the way in sales and profit, Microsoft was building a reputation for their high-quality and revolutionary devices. The 360 was the first game to heavily push online gaming and digital media. It was also the first Xbox to have wireless controllers. It was also the first console to experiment with motion sensing technology as a heavily-advertised part of their package. It was named the Kinect and was used for family-friendly active games to be played standing up and moving. The Kinect encouraged active lifestyles and family fun. The free addition to the system proved to be unpopular and was no longer packaged with later additions of the system. It became the first console of that generation to reach 10 million units sold globally, and it quickly sold out everywhere in the world except for Japan. That is understandable because their rival Sony, is based in Japan. One major issue with the console was only revealed well after the final unit was sold. After years of use, the console would quit on it's owner. It commonly became known as the "Red Ring Of Death." It gained this moniker because of it's four red lights illuminating in a circle. This problem was discovered years down the line, as the consoles became obsolete. The console will go down as the most sucessful in Microsoft's history to this point, and the highest moment in the series.</p>
